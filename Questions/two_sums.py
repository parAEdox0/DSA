1. Two Sum
Solved
Easy
Topics: Arrays, Hash Table
Companies: Many
Hint: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers 
such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 4
Output: [0, 2] (because nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 + 3 = 4)

Approaches:
1. Brute Force:
   - Use nested loops to check every pair of numbers in the array.
   - Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - checking all pairs.
   - Space Complexity: O(1) - only storing the result.
   - Pros: Simple to understand and implement.
   - Cons: Inefficient for large arrays.

2. Hash Map (Optimized):
   - Use a hash map to store numbers and their indices in one pass.
   - For each number, check if its complement (target - num) exists in the hash map.
   - Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array.
   - Space Complexity: O(n) - storing up to n elements in the hash map.
   - Pros: Much faster than brute force.
   - Cons: Uses extra space.
